Hello. I will explain some of the features of MemoView, the profile management website I created.

Login/Homepage:

-You can login with existing usernames here. 
-A default profile with Administrator rights can be accessed with Username: admin, Password: password


Registration Page:

-You can also create your own profile on this page. 
-If you try to register with an existing username, the form will not successfully pass.
-Additionally, the form should require you to enter a password of 8-15 characters.


User Page:

-This page displays user info. The navigation bar on the top will display the user's "First Name". If the user has 
	admin priviledges, then an extra "Administrator" button will appear in the navigation bar.
-User info can be seen by anyone. However, only the person who is logged in can edit their own profile as
	indicated by "pencil" icons next to each profile field.
-Memo field. This is an area where the user can enter whatever text he or she wishes post.


Search Page:

-A drop down list will contain all of the current registered and active users. The list will display both the 
	username and first name + last name of registered users. 
-After a selection has been made, the "Go" button will take the user back to the "User Page". However this time, the
	profile of the selected user will be displayed and fields for the profile will not be editable.


Administrator Page: 

-A page that can only be accessed by users with admin rights as indicated by the "Administrator" data field in the database.
-Admins can look at the login information of current registered users and make changes to the "Active" and "Administrator"
	database fields. In other works, admins can "delete" users manually here or give users admin rights.

Settings Page:

-Users can change their password here. 
-Users can also delete their accounts here.
